This is a simple gravity simulator implemented using HTML5 Canvas and JavaScript. The simulator demonstrates the basic principles of gravitational attraction between objects.

## Features
- Visualize gravitational interactions between objects.
- Adjustable parameters for simulation (e.g., mass, distance).
- Simple and intuitive interface.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository or download the files.
2. Open the `index.html` file in any modern web browser.
3. The simulator will run directly in the browser.

## Files
